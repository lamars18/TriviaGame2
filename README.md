The goal of this site was to create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, a screen shows congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up and display the correct answer. It automatically waits a few seconds, then show the next question.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Then it waits a few seconds and show the next question.

On the final screen, it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

This site not only meets the above requiremnts but it also includes a unique design.
